# LinkedList

~~This is an old school linked list. The method names are pretty messed up, it seems. Especially the `delete` methods. This is more for a learning experience than actual use.~~

## New School?

Not so old school anymore. I was told to implement a java.util.List\<E> in Java with JUnit tests. Because this is a
singly linked list, I did not implement the `listIterator` methods. I also didn't implement the `subList` method as it
requires implementing another List\<E> interface that satisfies its requirements.

__Note__: These 3 methods are not optional according to the Java documentation. I'm doing this for academic reasons as
well as the fact that I love doing projects like this. This is certainly not a complete implementation of the
interface.

## Old School

I was able to save the old school code and JUnit tests. Feel free to check those out too.

## Basic

Before Java, linked lists were pretty bare bones. This only has one `isEmpty()` convenience method and two insert and remove methods.
